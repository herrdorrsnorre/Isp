        <p>Due to british and chinese rule over the region Hong Kong culture has become a fusion of both Eastern and Western cultures. After 156 years of british rule the people of hong kong have begun to develop a unique cultural identity, a recent poll showed that 76% of young people in the city identified as a "hong konger". This unique culture seeps into every aspect of life from traditions to law, politics, education, language and cuisine. </p>
