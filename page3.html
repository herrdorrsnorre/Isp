            <p>The two official languages of Hong Kong are English and "Chinese". However english is only spoken by 54% of the population and the main dialect of chinese putonghua(mandarin) is only spoken by 49% percent of the population, this is likely due to british and chinese rule over the region. However yue chinese(cantonese) is spoken by 88.2% of the population and is the pseudo official language of hong kong.</p>

                <p>49% of hong kongs population follows chinese folk religion, this is obviously due to chinese influence. Buddism and taoism is a significant minority at 27.9%, hong kong's proximity to south east asian and southern china is likely the reason for this. The remaining religious groups are Christianity (12%, british influence), atheist/non religious(5.2%), Islam(4.2%), Hinduism(1.4%) and Sikhism(0.2%)</p>
