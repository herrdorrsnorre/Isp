        <p>Historically hong kong and the region of Guangdong(canton) served as one of the only entrypoints into the chinese economy for the british after they took the island in the first opium war. Now hong kong is a highly developed free market economy with very low tax rates and an almost free port trade. This makes hong kong one of the busiest ports in the world as over 456000 boats have arrived and departed from hong kong in 2020. Hong kong may be one of the busiest ports in the world and have one of the freest markets in the developed world hong kong doesn't produce much of anything, although they do export $23.8 billion worth of goods annually this is only about 6.4% of gdp. The economy of hong kong consists mostly of financial services, trading and logistics, professional services and tourism. </p>
